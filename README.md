# MATH343 Project - Solving 2D Heat Equation using Finite Elements Method
## Team Members: Georgia Corbett, Warren Wang

Written in MATLAB R2023a.

### Getting Started
Run `runme.m` which basically just calls the `main` function in `Solver.m`.
This will solve an ordinary differential equation with varying levels of convergence.

The final report, of which 90% is written by Georgia, can be found here as well,
detailing the theoretical background of using the Finite Elements Method.
